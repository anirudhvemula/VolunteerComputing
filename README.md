# VolunteerComputing
I donate my personal spare computing power via an ad-hoc computing cluster consisting of 3 servers running on Windows 10, Mac OS High Sierra (Repaired and Upgraded Mac Pro 2009), 2 laptops (Windows, Debian OS), Raspberry Pi 4 (Raspbian), Android (Lenovo) device and one instance of Windows 2008 server hosted by Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (only 30 days)
* Automated power outage protection with safe shutdowns using Windows.Net, Python (Linux) and Apple Swift.<br>
   check out my scripts respository
* Achieved consistent and reliable performance; an EMERALD Badge for World Community Grid – OpenPandemics COVID-19 v7.17 project.

[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/) or ["BOINC"](https://github.com/BOINC/) is a platform for distributed, volunteer computing developed by Univ of California Berkeley. I have been contributing for the following projects since mid 2020 (pandemic era) to present day:
<br>
* World Community Grid (IBM, now Krembil) <br>
-> OpenPandemics - COVID-19 <br>
-> Mapping Cancer Markers

* Einstein@Home (UWisc/MaxPlanck)
* LHC@home (CERN)
* MLC@Home (UMBC)
* NFS@Home (CSU Fullerton)
* Rosetta@home (UWash)
* GPU-GRID (Barcelona Biomedical Research Park- Medical Biology)


> LHC@HOME: Large Hadron Collider “SixTrack” simulates particles accelerating through the 27 km (17 mi)-long LHC to find their orbit stability.
> In one workunit, 60 particles are simulated travelling 100,000 or 1,000,000 loops, which would take about 10 seconds in an actual run. The orbit > stability data is used to detect if a particle in orbit goes off-course and runs into the tube wall—if this happened too often in actual running, > this would cause damage to the accelerator which would need repairs.

> OpenPandemics COVID-19 [IBM] project seeks chemical compounds that might be effective against COVID-19. The virtual screening experiments help
> predict which chemical compounds are likely to be effective at binding and stopping the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Promising compounds from
> these experiments will undergo further testing and analysis for the development of drugs. Attempting to manually screen these compounds in a
> traditional laboratory would not be possible because it would require a prohibitive amount of resources.

> Rosetta@home: this project determines 3D shapes of proteins in research that may ultimately lead to finding cures for some major human diseases
> such as HIV, Malaria, Cancer, and Alzheimer's. The shape (3D structure) largely determines the function of a protein and how it interacts with
> other molecules. Proteins are initially synthesized as long chains of amino acids and cannot function properly until they fold into intricate
> globular structures.
